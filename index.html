		<h1>Second-Rate Mind</h1>

		<h2><a href="essays/index.html">Essays</a></h2>

		<p>The name of this website is a reference to a statement by the mathematician G.H. Hardy, author of <cite>A Mathematician's Apology</cite>, that "exposition, criticism, 		appreciation [of art, science, math, etc.] is work for second-rate minds." Hardy wrote this from the perspective of an aging creator, lamenting his inability to continue 		to vigorously contribute to the field of mathematics. In his own words, he was becoming a "second-rate mind" by writing a book on the topic of mathematics. With this website, 		I intend to do something different.</p>

		<p>Hardy wrote with his days of being a first-rate mind behind him. I write this as someone who has never had the courage to be a creator, but who -- deciding that it is 		best to contribute positively to the world to act on that belief -- wants to become one. I write this on April 3rd, 2025, almost three months into a period of time in which 		many if us Usonians are waking up to the unacceptable state of the United States of America; a time where our environment constantly nags at our attention, exhausting us and 		leaving us with little capacity to engage meaningfully with our worlds, and with the people inhabiting them.</p>
